# IMS-ETG
## An Inventory Management System using Python(Jupyter Notebook)

* Sell_Products.ipynb is the main jupyter notebook file which houses the entire code that interfaces with a customer
* Add_Products.ipynb works with the seller. When new products are bought into the inventory, they get updated here
* records.json is a dynamic database that houses the available products in the inventory and updates the same, as and when products are sold to customers
* sales.json stores the details of products sold on a particular day. It contains arrays of dictionaries and can filter them based on date of purchase
